 We presented a system utilizing a GRU model with several
 data augmentation techniques for HAR using Wi-Fi CSI
  signals. Our findings highlighted the significant impact of
 enhancing time-series input representation and data augmen
tation. Specifically, our modelâ€™s accuracy increased over the
 baseline by approximately +2.8% in the HAR Dataset, by
 +23.6% in the ARIL Dataset, and by +9.6% in the Sign
Fi Dataset. However, there is still room for improvement in
 certain tasks. Future work will focus on developing a more
 lightweight model suitable for on-device deployment.
